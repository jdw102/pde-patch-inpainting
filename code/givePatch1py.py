'''
The givePatch1.m MATLAB function is an extension of the givePatch function with additional complexity. This function appears to be part of a texture synthesis or texture transfer process. It takes several parameters, including a texture (a), an input texture, an input target, a template patch (temp1), a mask, and a parameter al. The function calculates errors to find a patch in the input texture that best matches the template patch, considering both the input texture and the input target.

Key operations in this function include:

1. Error Calculation: Computes errors based on the input texture, input target, and the template patch.
2. Filtering and Convolution: Uses the filter2 function for convolution-like operations.
3. Combining Errors: Combines errors from different sources, weighted by the parameter al.

    temp3 = convolve2d(temp3, mask, mode='valid')

    # The function in MATLAB also returns 'nearPatch1', but its calculation is not included in the snippet.
    # Assuming nearPatch1 is a variant of near_patch, a placeholder is provided here. 
    # This may need to be adjusted based on the full MATLAB code.

'''
In the original MATLAB function, it returns nearPatch and nearPatch1, but the specific calculations for these return
values are not fully clear from the provided snippet. 
In the Python version, I have returned errors and used a placeholder for near_patch1,
which currently just returns the calculated errors.
This may need to be adjusted based on the full context of your MATLAB code.
