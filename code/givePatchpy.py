'''
The givePatch.m MATLAB file is a function used for selecting a patch from a texture based on certain criteria. The function takes an input texture, a template patch (temp1), and a mask, then calculates errors to find the patch in the input texture that best matches the template patch. Here's an overview of the key steps:

1. Error Calculation: Computes errors between the template patch and the input texture.
2. Minimum Error Identification: Finds the minimum error and selects patches with errors close to this minimum.
3. Random Selection: Randomly selects one of the patches that meet the error criteria.
4. Patch Extraction: Extracts the selected patch from the input texture.

    # The function in MATLAB also returns 'nearPatch1', but its calculation is not included in the snippet.
    # Assuming nearPatch1 is a variant of near_patch, a placeholder is provided here. 
    # This may need to be adjusted based on the full MATLAB code.
